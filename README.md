<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I selected this theme in honour of the individual after whom my institute was recently renamed, 
 inorder to shed light on his contributions to the world of Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence. </p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>My web is divided into 9 sections (three of which are Subsections)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hero Section</li>  
  <li>Contents</li>
  <li>Biography (subsection Contents)</li>
  <li>The Bombe (subsection Contents)</li>
  <li>Other Inventions (subsection Contents)</li>
  <li>Fun Facts</li>

<h3>Hero Section</h3>
<img src="https://github.com/spir611/MyAlanTuringProject_Bootstrap/blob/main/AT-readme-img/image_of_hero_page.png" alt="Hero Section Image Alan Turing" style="width:75%">
<p>I used a background image created via artificial intelligence in Dall-e which blends all the colours in my colour palette. I used a special Call to
 Action button "Enigma" associated with Alan Turing with an inverse color pattern initiated upon hovering. The Call to Action button 
 leads directly to the Contents Card Menu of the Web. The semi-transparent navigation bar is located along the superior portion of the Hero Section in PCs, 
 but tranforms into a hamburger menu, located in the superior right-hand corner, in tablets and mobile phones. The navigation bar is sticky and remains visible upon scroll.

<h3>Contents</h3>

<p>The section which is designed as one container using the container fluid class in Bootstrap to obtain proper responsiveness uses two separate grid layouts. The upper portion of the container consists of a  blockquote section and  the bottom portion contains a separate 3 column grid layout of 3 cards which respond according to device width: full width in movil devices, 50 percent in tablet devices and three equal columns in large and xxl screens. The cards, which contain theme-related images, act as a Contents
Menu which when clicked upon lead directly to one of the three subsections: The Biography <a href="https://assets.newatlas.com/dims4/default/2427127/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x819+0+0/resize/1200x960!/quality/90/?url=http:%2F%2Fnewatlas-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Farchive%2Fturing_turns100-1.jpg">Statue Image</a> , The Bombe <a href="https://assets.wired.com/photos/w_2500/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/COMPLETE-bombe-front-elevation.jpg">The Bombe Image</a> & Other Inventions <a href="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/turing-test-in-AI-768x432.png">Turing Test Image</a>  .</p>
<p></p>


<h3>Subsections (3):</h3>


<h3>(1)The Biography</h3>
<p>This subsection contains a responsive grid layout defined according to device width with a black and white portrait of Alan Turing: <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/81/191581-050-8C0A8CD3/Alan-Turing.jpg">Alan Turing Portrait</a>  and introduction paragraph of his biography. There also a Read More button styled
 with the special "Computer Style Lettering" used in all buttons. Upon clicking, the Read More button links directly to the Britannia Enciclopedia Web Page on Alan Turing´s Biography.</p>


<h3>(2)The Bombe</h3>
<p> This subsection contains a responsive grid layout defined according to device width. It contains a video created by Mr Sensible Historic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTNgeNFuCDM&t=1501s">(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTNgeNFuCDM&t=1501s)</a>,its the corrsponding link to YouTube and in addition, some related text. The ReadMore button links 
 to an article written by the National Museum of Computing reviewing the book released on the same topic "The Bombe: The Machine that defeated Enigma" by the author Dermot Turing.</p>


<h3>(3)Other Inventions</h3>
<p>This section contains an accordion designed from code snippet obtained from the official Getbootstrap web page personalized with a specially designed pattern background (created via an online pattern generator <a href="https://doodad.dev/pattern-generator/">https://doodad.dev/pattern-generator/</a>
 blending the colours used in the Project´s Colour Palette. As the original arrows are lost with Bootstrap when a background image is used, new unicode symbols were created as a subsitute to enhance proper intuitive useability. The two-section accordion upon click opens up to brief information on the Turing Test and the Turing Machine and each one 
contains a ReadMore button linking to articles relating to each of these inventions:</p>
  <ul>      
    <li><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-turing-test-7504875">https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-turing-test-7504875</a> </li>

  </ul> 
         

<p></p>
<h3>Fun Facts Section</h3>
<p>This section contains a responsive grid layout:1 in mobile screens and 2 columns in large and xxl large screens. The grid is composed of a video titled "Three Crazy Facts" by the Homo Deus Project with
corresponding link to Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6yma88eQhs">Three Crazy Facts Video </a> and an image containing a portrait of Alan Turing and the Apple logo. Upon clicking, the image links to an article written by Manchester´s Finest titled "Myths of
Manchester: The Apple Logo & Alan Turing."<a href="https://www.manchestersfinest.com/articles/manchester-myths-apple-logo-alan-turing/">https://www.manchestersfinest.com/articles/manchester-myths-apple-logo-alan-turing/  
Both components lay upon a black background to accentuate and add consistency to the content.</a></p>
<p></p>


<h3>Gallery Section</h3>
<p>This section contains a Carrousel (code snippet from Getbootstrap web page) with 6 images related to Alan Turing which were obtained from the following sources (links:)</p>
